Subscripting a vector from any position to any other position=&gt; x\[-\(6,10\)\] if x is a vector

Order vs Sort 

vector comparison, any logical check will return vectors. Type consistent 

Random Sampling methodologies : Reproducible and Non-Reproducible 

List in R like Dictionary in Python ..DataFrame is like a list with equal length 

Functions in list like Match or Which 

Control Structures and flows , Vectorization
